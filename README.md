# Deep Learning Based Math Expressions to LaTeX Translator

This is an assignment for the course COL774 (Deep Learning) at the IIT Delhi. The goal of this assignment was to create a model that can translate synthetic and handwritten mathematical expressions to LaTeX code.

The model uses an Encoder-Decoder architecture. The encoder is a CNN based model that extracts features from the input image. The decoder is an LSTM based model that generates the LaTeX code from the features extracted by the encoder.
